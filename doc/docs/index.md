Iflearner Flow is a multi-party joint task security scheduling platform based on the underlying federated learning framework [Iflearner](https://github.com/iflytek/iflearner), which for horizontal federated learning scenarios.

## Main Features
- [x] Support user-defined algorithm mirroring (mainstream deep learning algorithms can be integrated)
- [x] SMPC automatic networking (users do not need to care about network details)
- [x] Support large-scale cluster task scheduling (based on kubernetes)

## Function
- [x] Joint Job and Task Scheduling
- [x] Job real-time monitoring
- [x] REST API、CLI、SDK
- [x] Data access (local data)
- [ ] WEB
